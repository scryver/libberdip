This stuff is purely for my experiments and is under constant threat of a changing mind...

Thanks goes to Sean Barrett, Casey Muratori and Per Vognsen for parts and inspiration of the code.
If you ever plan to use any of this, I don't know how to untangle the usage of parts of their code
and mine, and am not willing at the moment. The stuff is correct and optimal for now, all the stuff
that is not good or seems weird (and I do not mean 'I don't understand c/c++' weird), is probably
my fault. 
I will in time ask permission for the usage of code, but if you want to do it yourself, go ahead: 
- Sean Barrett: https://github.com/nothings (stretchy buf, ttf-fonts, etc.)
- Casey Muratori: https://github.com/cmuratori (arena, platform ideas, random.h, etc.)
- Per Vognsnen: https://github.com/pervognsen (arena, map, string interning, etc.)

And if you hear anything from them, let me know :)
